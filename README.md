# Product Similarity MLOps Project

A simple MLOps project for product similarity. It includes text preprocessing, representation, and similarity calculation.

This directory contains an ML project based on the default
[Databricks MLOps Stack](https://github.com/databricks/mlops-stack),
defining a production-grade ML pipeline for automated retraining and batch inference of an ML model on tabular data.

See the [Project overview](./docs/project-overview.md) for details on the ML pipeline and code structure
in this repo.

## Using this repo

The table below links to detailed docs explaining how to use this repo for different use cases.

If you're a data scientist just getting started with this repo for a brand new ML project, we recommend starting with
the [Project overview](./docs/project-overview.md) and
[ML quickstart](./docs/ml-developer-guide-fs.md).


When you're satisfied with initial ML experimentation (e.g. validated that a model with reasonable performance can be
trained on your dataset) and ready to deploy production training/inference
pipelines, ask your ops team to follow the [MLOps setup guide](./docs/mlops-setup.md) to configure CI/CD and deploy 
production ML pipelines.

After that, follow the [ML pull request guide](./docs/ml-pull-request.md)
and [ML resource config guide](databricks-config/README.md) to propose, test, and deploy changes to production ML code (e.g. update model parameters)
or pipeline resources (e.g. use a larger instance type for model training) via pull request.
